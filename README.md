#  crypto-c

A repository of encryption and decryption algorithms written in pure C, intended for educational, academic, and cryptographic development purposes. Each algorithm is implemented in its own folder with clean, modular code and documentation.

## 📚 Included ciphers

 Implemented:

- **Caesar**  
- **Vigenère**  
- **XOR with key**
- **AES**  
- **RSA**  
- **Diffie-Hellman key exchange**  
- **Enigma machine simulation**

## 🛠️ How to build

Each cipher is placed in its own folder (e.g. `caesar/`, `vigenere/`, etc.).  
To compile a cipher, navigate into its folder and run:

```bash
gcc main.c -o cipher
./cipher
