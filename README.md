#  Caesar Cipher in C

This repository contains a clean and modular implementation of the **Caesar cipher**, written in C.  
It allows you to **encrypt and decrypt messages** using a user-defined shift key.  
Perfect for learning classic cryptography and C programming fundamentals.

## 📖 What is the Caesar Cipher?

The **Caesar cipher** is one of the oldest known encryption techniques, used by Julius Caesar.  
It works by shifting each **alphabetic character** in the message by a fixed number of positions in the alphabet.

### 🔄 How it works:

- **Encryption:** shift each letter **forward** by a given number (key)
- **Decryption:** shift each letter **backward** by the same number

### 📌 Example (Shift = 3):
Plaintext : HELLO WORLD
Encrypted : KHOOR ZRUOG
